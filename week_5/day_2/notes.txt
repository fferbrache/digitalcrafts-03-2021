export const apiKey = "123123"

Pokemon Example
First Goal is to see if you can get the information (Postman) and show it on the screen
We used Postman

Promises
PromiseState: "fulfilled"
PromiseResult: Response

resolved, pending, objective --> states in programming
promise is returning us something that is an object
whenever you can use a ".then()" on an  object, it is a Thenable object
promises are filled with .then()

.json() takes something and makes it into json

promise --> then I will see it is fulfilled --> then I will convert it into json

syntactic sugar

Promise.all() makes the program run faster

we will see this more when we get to node and have to do "call backs"
